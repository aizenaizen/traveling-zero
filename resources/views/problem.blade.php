<div style="padding: 10px; font-family: monospace; font-size: 30px;">
	You are presented with a two dimensional array (n x m) consisting entirely of 0's and 1's.
	<br><br>
	Develop an algorithm that validates whether or not it is possible to navigate through the matrix from a starting coordinate to a destination coordinate without crossing into any 1's.
	<br><br>
	You may move up, down, left and right, but not diagonally. Your code should be run time efficient. A brute force approach is less desirable.
	<br><br>
	For example:
	<div>
		<img src="/image.png"/>
	</div>
</div>
